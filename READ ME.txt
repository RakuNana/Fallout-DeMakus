Project done in Godot 3.2.3 so older versions may not work properly.

This was an idea for making an 8-bit version of Fallout New Vegas, Only got as
 
far as a few NPCs, with one having branching dialog. Only two of the houses
 
can be entered and they're two different items you can collect(A key(which
 
does nothing, I never got around to programming the locked door) And the 

Doctors bag, Which is a key item and will change the dialog of the quest giver!

Have fun tearing my code apart and seeing how it all works! I'm sure it's

already very messy  :]

ps. You may do whatever you like with this project. Just please credit me in

your work as the source code provider!
